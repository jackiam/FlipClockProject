Test 1. 200 steps, 1 second delay. Over 12 (simulated) hours 100% accuracy

Test 2. 17 steps, 1 second delay. Over 1 (simulated) hour, gained 1 minute. I believe this error will be additive.

Test 3. 16 steps. 1 second delay.  Over 1 (simulated) hour, lost 2 minutes. I believe this error will 
be additive.

Test 4. Because the actual step size should be 16.666â€¦, let's multiply times 3, run 3 minutes per step. 50 steps. This should solve accuracy.

Result 4. 100% accuracy over 3 (simulated) hours


In between tests the code got nasty and ugly. Erased everything, started over now testing time in 1 (simulated) hour increments. Seems to be working properly for 1000 steps.

Test 5. 50 steps are required for 3 minutes, I can achieve minute accuracy if for 2 sets of steps, the steps are equal to 16, for the third there will be 18 steps. This is a total of 50 steps per 3 which should result in smooth motion and no loss or gain of time

Result 5. 8+ (simulated) hours of 100% accuracy, waiting for more testing


Various tests and tweaks went un-documented. The current I'm going to say is test 12.

Test 12. Adjusted if statements to properly adjust the time. Steps and count will be changed in future tests, but this test includes the step variable amounts from the previous test. Real 1 hr test start at 12:30 pm. 

Result 12. At 1:30 pm, the clock lost 1 minute over the hour.


Test 13. Add 1 additional minute (16 steps) to the end of each hour. This should fix the issue. 
Test started at 1:38 pm.

Result 13. At 2:38 pm, the clock lost 1 minute over the hour.


Test 14. Using simulated time. Adding various Serial.print(); to see whats doing what. Each (simulated) minute is 1 second. Using this I should be able to see why its not off by 1 minute.

Result 14. count++ was in the wrong location, the if, else if, else tree was also wrong. The tree never got to the higher values due to wron orientation.


Test 15. Remove the higher value (mod15-mod60) if statements, go back to mod 3 at 18 and try again.

Result 15. It seems to be very consistent and not skipping time. Lets try over 1 real hour.


Test 16. Removed Serial.print(); to clean up serial. Now testing 1 real hour starting at 3:24 pm

Result 16. Works well. keeps time, but second drift due to inaccuracies with onboard RTC.

Test 17. Update time at the start of every hour to eliminate RTC inaccuracies.
