This is the code for my Flip Clock project. I am retrofitting a Soundesign 3464 with an arduino r4 wifi and a stepper motor. Various other little tweaks and will be included. The best code block to use for keeping time is Modified Working Clock. This implementeed things that I should have originally added to WorkingClock. Take a look at the code to make sense of it. The comments hopefully will be helpful.
